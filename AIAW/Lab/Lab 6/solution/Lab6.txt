What worked:
A good part of the code was good but it had to be updated a lot even the working code because of the 800+ warnings that I encountered.
Warnings on the matter of deprecated methods that suggest the fact that they were at that time okay to use but given the progress over the years they became
deprecated and othe methods , that are better , should be used instead.

What did not work:
In newer versions , there cannot be anymore a variable named "enum" because this is now a keyword.
Plus other minor problems encountered.
For example the fact that the path to the properties files are hardcoded and given the fact that this project is not a java projet ,
in case the path in the project would modify , the program would not find the properties files.
		
What you experimented with:
I experimented all 3 types of agents and also experinced the problem with the website that is later discussed in the text of the laboratory.

Output samples:
There are images attached that show samples of the output.


Solutions for the problem related to the fact that the website from where the information for the scheduler agent is missing:
1.Keep the files that were on the website locally into the project.
2.Create a new website with all the information needed.
3.Keep all the files needed on cloud.
4.Do not keep a hardcoded string of the website in the project. At least keep it in a separate file from the code that uses it.
5.to be continued when I think of new ones.
